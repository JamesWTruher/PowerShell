## Minimum gates (TODO)

Our [pull request template][pr-template] includes the bare minimum requirements for a pull request to be accepted into PowerShell. This includes:
* Writing tests
* Writing documentation (where does thie one live already? is it where this guidance should exist all up?)
* Repository maintainer sign-off, per our [governance model][governance]

[pr-template]: ../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
[governance]: ../community/governance.md
